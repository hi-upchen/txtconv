# Vercel Blob Storage - Required for archiving uploaded files

#
# SECURITY NOTICE - Access Control Limitations:
# ==============================================
# As of January 2025, Vercel Blob does NOT support private access:
#
# 1. Only 'public' access is available - all blobs are publicly accessible via URL
# 2. Private access is planned but no ETA announced (GitHub issue #816)
# 3. Current security relies on cryptographically random URLs (addRandomSuffix: true)
#
# What this means:
# - Anyone with the blob URL can access the file
# - URLs are practically impossible to guess without knowledge
# - This is "security through obscurity", not true access control
#
# Recommendations:
# - Do NOT store sensitive/private data in Vercel Blob at this time
# - Use alternative storage (S3, etc.) if true private access is required
# - Consider edge middleware authorization for access control
#
# Local development: Files stored in .vercel/output/blob/
# Production: Files uploaded to Vercel Blob (publicly accessible)
